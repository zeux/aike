- don’t resolve types with multiple constraints
- do more constraint solving in one pass
- resolve field names and ident types immediately during typing - does this make typing faster?
- intern all types + cache codegen data based on type ptr
- parsing indentation needs rethinking.
- use i8 for void?
- fixed-size array type? (how’d custom index op work?)
- overloading can be based on constraints - e.g. gather constraints and run overload reduction step before/after propagation. might lead to rettype-based overloading though which requires mangling support
- mangling should preserve rettype even for non-generic fns somehow - look into demangler for clues?
- refactor integer/double parsing (use llvm?)
- runner has weird issue with capturing out/err - commenting clear() does not break the dump test, as if compiler does not capture stdout.
- add keywords to tokenizer

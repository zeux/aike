A list of stuff to do for aike.

- mutually recursive type definitions
- mutually recursive function definitions
- mutually recursive value definitions in some cases? (introduces potential for uninitialized variable access :-/)

- better errors for type inference: blocks - error on last expression

- better errors:
type expr =
      Int int
    | Var int


let x = 5 in x
